Minimum steps to reach destination


 int reachNumber(int target) {
        
        // the basic idea used is that changing sign of some elements of configuration when destination is even gives us the result
          int sum  = 0;
        int steps = 0;
        target = abs(target); // the polarity of target doesnt make any difference because it //would take equal steps to go on positive or negative side
        while(sum<target){  // come out of the loop if sum becomes equal to target
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        while((sum-target)%2){ // keep adding steps till the diff is odd to make it even
            sum+=steps;
            steps++;
        }
        return steps-1;
    }
